# LLM-CloudSec: Large Language Model Empowered Automatic and Deep Vulnerability Analysis for Intelligent Clouds
This is our code repository, and we completed our experiments based on the cleaned Juliet and D2A datasets, thanks to the authors of the paper "_Data Quality for Software Vulnerability Datasets_" for their contributions.
The classification results of the Juliet C++ dataset and D2A_analyzed are stored in the [results](/results).
